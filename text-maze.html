    <h1>Text-Based Maze Game</h1>
    <p>This is the a simple maze game that is made out of plaintext. The one one playable here is written in JavaScript because it made integrating it into a webpage much easier.
    However, the original version is written in Python because it's what I was learning at the time.</p>
